# ♟️Chess with Flutter

This a side project of mine, where I am trying to build a chess game in flutter. Even tho there's a flutter game tool-kit but still I'm doing it with flutter. Cz most probably I'm dumb.😪 </br>
But this is mostly for learnign purpose. Rn learning `flutter-bloc` with it. And experimenting with the `drag&drop` system.
>**⚠️Warning :**
>This project is completely used for learning purpose by a `flutter-noob`. Judge the code structure and everything wisely. And any help and suggestion will be much appreciated.
